# Naive Bayes Classification Project

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a Naive Bayes classification model using Python.
The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, performance evaluation, and final results.

🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm to a dataset and classify the target variable based on the input features.
The steps covered in the notebook:

- Loading and inspecting the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Handling missing values and categorical variables
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training a Naive Bayes model
- Evaluating performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics

🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

📊 Model Evaluation

The notebook includes:

- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Visualizations

These help you understand how well the Naive Bayes classifier performs on the dataset.
